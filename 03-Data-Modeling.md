# Data Modeling

Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
 
 * Fewer bugs and errors

 * produces a higher overall test coverage

 * therefor to better quality of the final product.

In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

* beforeEach() runs before each test and afterEach() runs after each test both automatically respectivily.

What is one downside of Test Driven Development

* when writting long code it takes too long to change or alter it.

Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

* class is called at runtime but a prototype is related on the object its in.

Why REST?

* its very flexiable in terms it can handle different data formats and more.

functional programming?

* is a way of developing software construction through pure functions.

object-oriented programming (OOP)?

* A method of writting code that creates common objects that allows the creation of different objects from it.

class?

* Is a template for creating objects.

super?

* Keyword used to access and call functions from an objects parent.

this?

* Keyword that refers to a object.

Test Driven Development (TDD)?

* Its a dev. practise that creats unit tests before writing the actual code.

Jest?

* its a library for testing javascript code.

Continuous Integration (CI)?

* is a new dev. practice in which small changes of code are made more reliably and frequently.

REST?

* it can handle different data formats and more, therefor most refer to it as being very flexiable.

Data Model?

* Is made of entities that we track and are displayed in tables in the database.


Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

* SQL is a relational database where noSQL is the opposite

* running queries in noSQL is possible but much slower.

* SQL databases are more suited for heavey and complex transactions.


Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

* many complex examples about both.

* see the implentation of SQL modeling in depth.

* multiple examples of noSQL database.

What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

* to be educated more about Sequelize API.

### sql vs nosql

* SQL databases are more suited for heavey and complex transactions and is a relational database where noSQL is the opposite, while running queries in noSQL is possible but much slower.

*  SQL have a predefined schema where noSQL has a dynamic one. The Sql has the ability to manipulate data where noSQL is primaryly used for collection of documents.

### sql modeling techniques

* SQL database modeler is a cloud based data moduler and administrative tools that enables us to make databases easier on your web

* its a free graphical tool for Oracle databases, data modular tools can create, browse and edit them.

### sequelize api

Sequelize is a promise based Node.js for Postgres, MySQL and more.

* Its catagorised as Object Relational Mapper its a open source tool.

* A great advantage for having sequelize are the different database system without having to rewrite the database queries logic.
