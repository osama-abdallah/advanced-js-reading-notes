# React Native

React Native is like React, but it uses native components instead of web components as building blocks. So to understand the basic structure of a React Native app, you need to understand some of the basic React concepts, like JSX, components, state, and props. If you already know React, you still need to learn some React-Native-specific stuff, like the native components. This tutorial is aimed at all audiences, whether you have React experience or not.

Create native apps for Android and iOS using React React Native combines the best parts of native development with React, a best-in-class JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Use a little—or a lot. You can use React Native today in your existing Android and iOS projects or you can create a whole new app from scratch.

React primitives render to native platform UI, meaning your app uses the same native platform APIs other apps do.

Many platforms, one React. Create platform-specific versions of components so a single codebase can share code across platforms. With React Native, one team can maintain two platforms and share a common technology—React.

## EXpo

Expo is a framework and a platform for universal React applications. It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase.

If you are already experienced with React and JavaScript tooling and want to dive right in and figure things out as you go, this is the quickest way to get started:

npm install --global expo-cli

expo init my-project
