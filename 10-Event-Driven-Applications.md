# Event Driven Applications

* Why is access control important?

Access controls limit access to information and information processing systems.

* Describe an application that would need access control.

Various access control examples can be found in the security systems in our doors, key locks, fences, biometric systems, motion detectors, badge system

* What is a role used for?

An organization assigns a role-based access control role to every employee; the role determines which permissions the system grants to the user

* Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

Mandatory Access Control where access to system resources is controlled by the operating system, Discretionary Access Control allows each user to control access to their own data.

* Authorization

 a security mechanism to determine access levels or user/client privileges

* Role Based Access Control

is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users.

* Capabilities

A capability describes a transferable right to perform one or more operations on a given object.

### Event Driven Programming

An event-driven application is a computer program that is written to respond to actions generated by the user or the system and is any identifiable occurrence that has significance for system hardware or software an example a user action such as a mouse click, key press, or a message from the operating system or another program.

### Node docs: events

where you can create-, fire-, and listen for- your own events. To include the built-in Events module use the require() method. In addition, all event properties and methods are an instance of an EventEmitter object.
