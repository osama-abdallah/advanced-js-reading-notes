# Login and Auth

we will combine Authentication (valid user is logged in) and Authorization (what permissions does the user have) to create a UI that ensures that users only have access to content and functionality that theyâ€™re granted access to.

## What is Role-Based Access Control?

Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.

Employees are only allowed to access the information necessary to effectively perform their job duties. Access can be based on several factors, such as authority, responsibility, and job competency. In addition, access to computer resources can be limited to specific tasks such as the ability to view, create, or modify a file.

### BENEFITS OF RBAC

1. Reducing administrative work and IT support
2. Maximizing operational efficiency
3. Improving compliance
