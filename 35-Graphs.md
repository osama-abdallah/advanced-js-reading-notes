# Graphs

A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

Here is some common terminology used when working with Graphs:

* Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
* Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
* Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
* Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

## Directed vs Undirected

### Undirected Graphs

An Undirected Graph is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional. This means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.

For example, in the graph below, Node C is connected to Node A, Node E and Node B. There are no “directions” given to point to specific vertices. The connection is bi-directional

## Directed Graphs (Digraph)

A Directed Graph also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed.

Unlike an undirected graph, a Digraph has direction. Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.

Compare the visual below with the undirected graph above. Can you see the difference? The Digraph has arrows pointing to specific nodes.

## Traversals

### Breadth First

In a breadth first traversal, you are starting at a specific vertex/node. This node must be specified when calling the BreadthFirst() method. The breadth-first traversal of a graph is like that of a tree, with the exception that graphs can have cycles. Traversing a graph that has cycles will result in an infinite loop….this is bad. To prevent such behavior, we need to have some way to keep track of whether a vertex has been “visited” before. Upon each visit, we’ll add the previously-unvisited vertex to a visited set, so we know not to visit it again as traversal continues.

### Depth First

In a depth first traversal, we approach it a bit different than the way we do when working with a depth first traversal of a tree. Similar to how the breadth-first uses a queue, we are going to use a Stack for our depth-first traversal.

The algorithm for a depth first traversal is as follows:

1. Push the root node into the stack
2. Start a while loop while the stack is not empty
3. Peek at the top node in the stack
4. If the top node has unvisited children, mark the top node as visited, and then Push any unvisited children back into the stack.
5. If the top node does not have any unvisited children, Pop that node off the stack
6. Repeat until the stack is empty.
