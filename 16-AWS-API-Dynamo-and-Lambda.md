# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

### AWS API Gateway Overview

API Gatewayis a managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API and connect those endpoints with the corresponding backend business logic. It also handles authentication, access control, monitoring, and tracing of API requests.

### Amazon DynamoDB

Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale. It's a fully managed, multi-region, multi-active, durable database with built-in security, backup and restore, and in-memory caching for internet-scale applications. DynamoDB can handle more than 10 trillion requests per day and can support peaks of more than 20 million requests per second.

what the advantages of DynamoDB?

* reliable performance even as it scales;
* A managed experience, so you won't be SSH-ing into servers to upgrade the crypto libraries;
* A small, simple API allowing for simple key-value access as well as more advanced query patterns.

### Dynamoose

Dynamoose is a modeling tool for Amazon's DynamoDB. Dynamoose is heavily inspired by Mongoose, which means if you are coming from Mongoose the syntax will be very familar.
