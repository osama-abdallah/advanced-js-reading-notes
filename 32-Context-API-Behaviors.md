# Context API - Behaviors

Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

In a typical React application, data is passed top-down (parent to child) via props, but such usage can be cumbersome for certain types of props (e.g. locale preference, UI theme) that are required by many components within an application. Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.

* When to Use Context
* Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language.

Before You Use Context Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels. Apply it sparingly because it makes component reuse more difficult.

If you only want to avoid passing some props through many levels, component composition is often a simpler solution than context.

Hooks and context example After performing an audit on how we communicate with our users, we landed with a simple system of three classes of communication, and snackbars fit perfectly on the ‘low priority’ end of that spectrum. They are small notifications that show up on the screen when a user performs an action. They are not intrusive at all and appear for just a brief moment.

From an engineering standpoint, our snackbar system must easy to use and generally be very lightweight. We want to be able to place one on the screen with just a couple of lines of code. Anything more and it’s overkill.

This means forget render props and higher order components. We don’t want to deal with a messy React tree and wrappers. We don’t want action creators, reducers, or any of that stuff.
