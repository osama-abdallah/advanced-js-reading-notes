### Big O

The Big O it used to define the complextiy and performance of an algorithim. It weights those things by simply dividing them in space used meaning the size of the code through the lines in it and time as in the time the algorithem takes to be completed, to then give it a sort of grade if its any good or not becaue as we all know there can always be a better code till there isnt. So summerize its the method by whic we classify to determine how good is the code. 



### Linked Lists

Linked List its a linear collection system for data elements in which its element order inst given by a actual physical location in the memory. its usually used for how efficent its insertion and deletion and its usually used to carry out mulltiple things like stacks, queues and many other data types. it works by using more memory than ArrayList as a reason  to it is it stores one for the previous item and one for the next item also elements in a linked list must be read in order from the beginning as linked lists are inherently sequential access.
