# AWS: Cloud Servers

## AWS EC2

It’s a service provided by Amazon. The term AWS EC2 stands for “Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud”. it is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

Amazons simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. Also, It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.

## EC2 For Humans

EC2 is a service, where clients can rent a virtual machine server, that is independent form other virtual machines that are on AWS server.

Through amazon site you can create an instance , where you can choose the type of operating system, memory size, number of CPUs, storage capacity and more.

This virtual machine can be used for storing data, web application, machine learning and more.

There are different settings that fit each usage, related to access and privacy.

## Elastic Beanstalk

Elastic Beanstalk is a service that deploys, manages and scales web apps and services on behalf of the developer.

Elastic Beanstalk uses managed containers like:

* java.net

* PHP

* Node.js

* Python

* Ruby

* docker

## Virtual Machine

Operating system:

It is a software that control the hardware of a computer. Virtual Machine Manager: It is a software that allows us to run an operating system within another operating system. Examples:

* VirtualBox

* vmware

An operating system created by Virtual Machine Manager is called a Virtual Machine.

### Reasons to use Virtual Machines

* Trying a new operating system.

* Testing an application.

* Running old applications.

## Virtualization and Cloud Computing

Virtualization allows us to better utilize the resources we have available in out machine. Virtualization is when many Virtualization Machines are controlled and operate inside one single machine. This gives us the following advantages:

* Fewer machines.

* Lower capital investment.

* Centralized management.

* Lower operation cost.

Cloud Computing is when someone is using a computer that is in another location.
