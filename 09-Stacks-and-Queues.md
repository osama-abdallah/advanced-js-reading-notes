# Stacks and Queues

### Stacks

A stack is a data structure that holds a list of elements. A stack works on the idea of Last In, First out, referring to the last element added to the first to be removed. A stack has two main operations which are push and pop these functions are similar to the array, they are also way more liminted compared to arrays a stack of dinner plates on top of each other is the perfect example of stacks as you would remove the plate on top first which would be the last plate to be put in the stack.

### Queues

A queue is an abstract data structure which is an ordered list of elements where whats put in the end of the queue and but when you remove its taken from the front of the queue this is special property where you can push from one end and pop from another end. A queue works based on the first-in, first-out principle, which is different from a stack, which works based on the last-in, first-out principle. Queues has the following methods push and shift to insert or unshift and pop to remove. Multiple types of queues exist such as Circular Queue,
Priority Queue, Double-Ended Queue and much more.
