# Open-Source Software Contribution

* Open source software is free for you to use and explore. Get involved to perfect your craft and be part of something big.

* Shape the future of software Your contributions help make technology better for everyone, developers and non-developers alike.

* Work with the best in the field Amazing developers use GitHub. Contribute code to projects that change how software is built.

* Grow your skills and help others Whatever your skill level, working on open source software is a great way to learn new things.

 for developers especially, contributing to open-source software provides many valuable advantages and opens doors to a number of highly lucrative and rewarding opportunities, and there are not too many other industries that can boast the massive number of global contributions like the open-source community can.

While each person may have different individual motivations, here is a list of some of the most common reasons why developers contribute to open-source software:

Improve Coding Skills As with almost all professionals, the only way to truly learn and perfect your craft is to practice, practice, practice. However, few professions provide the means to practice on real projects. A mechanic, for example, can gain skills and experience by working on his own car or a friend’s, but won’t necessarily receive the valuable feedback from a seasoned mechanic needed to further develop his skills.
For developers, contributing to OSS means that they not only practice their programming skills, but that they also learn and gain feedback from more accomplished programmers. This jumping-in-the-deep-end style of learning provides aspiring programmers with real-life, first-hand experience and greatly accelerates their learning curve.

In order to help young programmers improve their skills, a number of OSS projects now include tickets designed for aspiring programmers to gain genuine programming experience, such as Symfony’s selection of easy picks. Apart from providing novice programmers with experience, they also free up the core developers’ schedule so they can spend that time tackling more difficult issues or improving the software in other ways.

Here are 6 ways in which developers are benefitted by contributing to open source:

1. Helps in writing cleaner code:

2. Gain recognition:

3.A better understanding of technology:

4. Helps in being prepared for the project:

5. Reduces development costs:

6. Builds the organisation’s reputation
