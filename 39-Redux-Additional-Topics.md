# Redux - Additional Topics

## Redux Toolkit

* Simple
* Opinionated
* Powerful
* Effective

Includes utilities to simplify common use cases like store setup, creating reducers, immutable update logic, and more.

Provides good defaults for store setup out of the box, and includes the most commonly used Redux addons built-in.

Takes inspiration from libraries like Immer and Autodux to let you write "mutative" immutable update logic, and even create entire "slices" of state automatically.

Lets you focus on the core logic your app needs, so you can do more work with less code.

State is the heart of each application and there is no quicker way to create buggy, unmanageable applications than by producing an inconsistent state or state that is out-of-sync with local variables that linger around. Hence many state management solutions try to restrict the ways in which you can modify state, for example by making state immutable. But this introduces new problems; data needs to be normalized, referential integrity can no longer be guaranteed and it becomes next to impossible to use powerful concepts like classes in case you fancy those.

## Hookstate

* Easy to Use
* Incredibly Fast
* Feature Rich
* First-class Typescript
* Plugins System
* Development Tools

Concise, pragmatic but flexible API. Very easy to learn. See Getting Started and other code samples to learn it in minutes.

Incredible performance based on unique method for tracking of used/rendered and updated state segments. Ideal solution for huge states and very frequent updates. Learn more....

Small core library packed with features: global states, local states, asynchronously loaded states, partial state updates, deeply nested state updates, and a lot more...

Complete type inferrence for any complexity of structures of managed state data. Full intellisense support tested in VS Code.

Extend or customize your state hooks. There are several standard plugins available: initial state value, touched fields tracking, modified fields tracking, state validation, persistence, and a lot more...

Develop like a pro. Browser's extension to trace and set state values, to set breakpoints on state changes, to identify components using a segment of a state, and more.
