* Explain what a “Singleton” is (in Computer Science terms) and how its pattern can be used with Node modules, specifically with classes??

Singleton is a class that only permits a indivisual instance of itself to be created and only allows a way in for that created instance usually containg static variables that can handle special and private intances of itself.

* If you were tasked with building a middleware system like Express uses, what approach might you take to construct/operate it?

i would use them to logg some important data like date and time to logg any action taken globa;y in the website and will follow it through to authenticate the user trying to access the data to see if he is the user that is allowed access if so will allow him to go through with his request if not to display a message to notify that access has been denied.

* Term?

Keyword or string related to an action to carry out a task or function.

* Router Middleware

its a piece of code that is in between the request and response to modify data or call the next middleware in line.

* Dynamic Module Loading

its the action of loading a library into the memory to retrieve a set of functions and variables during run time.

* Singleton Pattern

its a software design that restricts the start for a class to an indivsual instance.

* CRUD -> REST Method Matches

REST is a very popular design styles for web API, CRUD refers to the 4 functions of Create, Read,Update and delete.

* Mock Testing

Mocking is to create faking versions of external or internal services that stands in for the real ones to carry out testing to check the service.

### Securing Passwords

Securing paswords is how to prevent the reach of unaccessed users to the data stored through multiple functions and in return there are multiple ways hackers use to attack the variouse methods of securing passwords in the case of the artyicle i read was Bcrypt hashing function which hacker use a method called brute force attack to try and beat it which apperantly its amune to it.

### Basic Auth

basic Authentication its a simple method of verifying the user trying to access data and if he is allowed to do so by giving each user a username and password which you ask him for them to sign it and retrieve his data


### OWASP auth cheatsheet

OWASP stands for the open web application security project its a non profit foundation dedicated to improving the security of softwares. it preform security for certain forms of data for some specific attacks and cant be relied on alone as the only method for security.


### bcrypt docs

its a password hashing function used to build a passwrod security to protect from hacking by storing the password in bycrpted format. thr bcrypt refers to the blowfish encryption algorthim which uses salt and magic value.
